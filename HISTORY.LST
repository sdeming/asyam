6-24-93 SAD (Scott A. Deming)
===========
    - Initialial semi-release.

6-25-93 SAD
===========
    - Created this "history.doc" file.
    - MSRStatus and LSRStatus arrays removed, and placed into
      async_portS structure as int MSRstatus, and int LSRstatus.
    - Changed async_set_DTR, async_set_RTS, async_DTR_status,
      async_RTS_status functions to use MCR_DTR & MCR_RTS macros for
      a more formal appeal.

6-28-93 SAD
===========
    - Noticed a line of code left in asyio.c, function async_putch() that
      shouldn't be there.  It was an out to the Interrupt Enable Register
      that is called in async_putch_timeout already.  Calling it twice is
      rather useless.  My mistake. :)
    - Added an async_printf function that uses stdargs.  I'm kind of torn
      between using a dynamically allocated buffer and using the stack for
      the buffer.  I figure dynamically there really isn't anything to lose
      but if I used the stack I would be asking for trouble.
    - Added async_gets function which will input size number of characters
      or stop when a carriage return and or linefeed is reached.
    - Added async_getblock_timeout which polls the RX buffer for x number
      of milliseconds before returning.
    - Added MACROs and Global variables to documentation.
    - Made use of the NUMBEROFPORTS MACRO where it should have been used
      before.  I think I covered most of it.
    - Added a TO-DO list.  (See: todo.doc)
    - Made a new makefile, hopefully it's more portable than the old one.
      It's a lot easier to follow than Borlands PRJ2MAK style.
    - Made makefile create ASYNCLIB.LIB.  Much nicer to work with.  Only
      have to link with ASYNCLIB.LIB instead of each individual .OBJ.
    - Created a distribution list for easy mailing.

6-29-93 SAD
===========
    - Removed the window(1,2,80,25) call in term.c.  It was used for testing
      something previously, and I forgot to remove it before.
    - Pre-Released again.

7-2-93 SAD
==========
    - Created the mailing list.  Added all names of people who were interested
      to my elm aliases file and we'll go from there.
    - A little cleanup here and there.
    - Decided to release yet another pre-release for the mailing list.  So
      that everyone is up to date with everything.
    - Changed inline assembly calls for sti and cli to _enable() and _disable()
      for portability.  Notified of this by Christian Blum.  Thanks again!

7-6-93 SAD
==========
    - Added a little more information to the Makefile.  What means what.
    - Changed ASYNC.H and Makefile to be a bit more compatible:
      Makefile:
        COMPILER macro added to support BORLANDC, TURBOC, and MSC.
      ASYNC.H:
        Compatibility definitions section added allowing us to use
        Power C, Microsoft C, Turbo C, and Borland C.  I have only
        tested Borland C and Power C though.
        Among these additions are:
            _dos_setvect and _dos_getvect function naming.
            _OLDISR macro defined.
            _enable, _disable added for Power C and Turbo C.
            clrscr remapped to clrscrn for Power C.
    - Added PC_COMP.C for Power C compatibility.  This file contains
      a delay function that I'm hoping works.  I haven't tested it yet.
    - Created a project file for Power C, along with ASYNCLIB.C which is
      a strange way to make a library.  But this is MIX's idea.  I took
      the idea straight from their project file for the runtime library.
    - Changed 16460 to 16450
    - Changed set_handshaking function.  Beginning implementation of
      handshaking routines.

7-7-93 SAD
==========
    - Still working on handshaking implementation.  It's confusing for a
      little guy like me.
    - Added ISR_exit() for removing the installed ISR on an abnormal exit.
      This will be called any time the program ends, and will remove the ISR
      on each port it's installed on.  This may be too low level, meaning,
      you may wnat to make a call to close_port() within this exit function
      so it will shut down the FIFO, and do the normal maintenance routine.
      This is basically just to keep the ISR from hanging around when your
      program exits in an odd spot.  I strongly suggest using close_port()
      in areas where you know the port is being closed.
    - Revamped the ISR's quite a bit.  Had some bugs in it that I never knew
      existed.
    - Moved set_handshaking() from SET_UART.C to HSHAKE.C.  It's fits better
      there.
    - Full XON/XOFF implementation complete.  Next on the agenda is RTS/CTS.
    - Added async_tx_enable() function which basically just forces the ISR
      to call ISRtx().  This is really kind of an internal function.  It
      seems to me that there should be a better way of handling what it is,
      but I have failed to find one.  This works good so far.
    - Added LSR_ macros.  They aren't used yet, but they will be.
    - Created HSHAKE.C which contains the majority of the handshaking code.
    - I dramatically tested the XON/XOFF handshaking with Telemate and it
      worked GREAT sending and receiving an ASCII file at 115200 BPS.
    - Revised TERM.C minimally -- Needs work to show off true power.
    - Cleaned up some warnings, but not all.
    - Put an //add by anything that needed to be added to the lousy docs.
    - Fixed up and cleaned up to be compatible with PowerC again.  Lost the
      portability with a few of the changes.  Wasn't a big deal to fix though.
    - Added a few things and removed an item from TODO.LST.  Got rid of the
      XON/XOFF flow control item, and added a few various items.

7-8-93 SAD
==========
    - I think RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR flow control are in, but I can't think
      of how I can test it.  I think they're there now though.

7-12-93 SAD
==========
    - Pre-Released again.  Now with full Handshaking, and an improved
      TERM.  Also included is "The_Serial_Port" summary!
