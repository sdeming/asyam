This is an old libray I wrote in the early 90's to do async serial
communications in MS-DOS. Ultimately it was used in point of sale software
for downloading and reports from various stores.

This library was based on Christian Blum's excellent tutorials. It provides
an interesting insight to how I wrote code more than 15 years ago (and
counting).

Stored here, mostly for preservation.
