Whats new you ask?
==================

o   Read "HISTORY.LST"  This has a complete listing of every change I make.
    Even the little ones.

o   Christian Blum's "The_Serial_Port" will now be distributed with each
    release.  I will be sure to keep as up to date as possible.

o   Handshaking now works.  I think.

o   PowerC is now fully supported.  Use "ASYNCLIB.PRJ" for Power C.

o   I'm pretty sure it's compatible with Microsoft C now too, but I don't
    have it and can't test it.

o   I modified TERM.C in a couple of ways.  It's a little better now, but
    was never really inteded to be good for anything except showing how
    the code can be used.
