Things To Do
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Full 16550A fifo support -- I'm not sure it's not already there...
* Good documentations.  Anyone interested?
- Support Phar Laps DOS Extender.  I use it here at work, so why not make
  these routines portable to it.  Besides, I have to for a project I'm
  currently working on.
- Fossil support.  This should be fairly simple.  According to Ralf Browns
  PC Interrupts.
- Terminal Emulation Filters (Ansi, VT52, VT100, VT102, any others?)
  Anyone interested?
- File Transfer Protocols (Ascii, XModem, YModem, ZModem, Kermit, etc)
  A little note about this.  I would like it to be a "polled" protocol
  where you keep calling a certain function.  This would make it easy
  for simple multi-tasking.  Anyone interested?
- Portability to other C compilers:
        DJGCC, MicroSoft C, Watcom, Power C, High C, Zortech C++ (perhaps)
  Anyone have a compiler or two to spare?
- Make Files and Project Files for each compiler.
- C++ wrapper.  If I ever decide to learn C++.
- Support for add-on third party boards such as digi-board.  These I have
  absolutely no information for, experience with, or knowledge of.


* Must finish these items up first, for the first initial complete release.
